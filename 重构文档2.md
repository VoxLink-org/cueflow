# CueFlow Landing Page Refactoring Notes (Eleventy)

This document summarizes the extracted information from the `old-src` directory to aid in refactoring the CueFlow landing page using Eleventy.

## Extracted Localized Content

The translatable strings are available in the following files:

*   `old-src/locales/en.json`
*   `old-src/locales/zh-CN.json`

These files contain key-value pairs for English and Simplified Chinese translations, respectively.

## Page Structure and Content Analysis (from App.tsx)

The main sections of the landing page are:

1.  **Header:**
    *   Main title, subtitle, and descriptive paragraph.
    *   "Download Now" and "Explore Use Cases" buttons.
    *   Language switcher and GitHub wiki link.
    *   Uses fade-in animation.
2.  **Video Section:**
    *   Displays the `lesson.mp4` video.
    *   Uses fade-in animation.
3.  **Key Features Section:**
    *   Title: "Key Features".
    *   Grid of feature cards.
    *   Each card has an icon, localized title, and localized description.
    *   Uses slide-in animation for cards.
4.  **Use Cases Section:**
    *   Title: "Use Cases".
    *   Grid of use case cards.
    *   Each card has a localized title, localized description, and an image URL.
    *   Some cards are linked to specific routes (`/live-stream-interaction`, `/job-interview`).
    *   Uses slide-in animation for cards.
5.  **Installation Guide Section:**
    *   Title: "Mac Installation Guide".
    *   Localized text instructions.
    *   Terminal command: `sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/CueFlow.app`.
    *   "Copy" button.
6.  **Footer:**
    *   Copyright information.
    *   Link to the GitHub repository.

## Component and Utility Analysis

*   **`LanguageSwitcher.tsx`**: Handles language selection, updates `i18n` state, and saves to `localStorage`. Requires client-side JavaScript implementation in Eleventy.
*   **`Footer.tsx`**: A simple component with copyright and a GitHub link. Can be implemented as an Eleventy partial.
*   **`button.tsx`**: Defines a reusable Button component with variants and sizes using `cva` and `cn`. The styling will need to be applied directly using Tailwind CSS classes in Eleventy templates.
*   **`lib/utils.ts` (cn function)**: A helper for merging Tailwind CSS classes. The equivalent in Eleventy is direct application of classes in templates.

## Identified Assets and Links

*   **Video:** `public/lesson.mp4` (assuming it will be moved to the public directory or handled by Eleventy's asset management).
*   **External Links:**
    *   GitHub Wiki: `https://github.com/VoxLink-org/cueflow/wiki`
    *   GitHub Releases: `https://github.com/VoxLink-org/cueflow/releases`
    *   GitHub Repository (Footer): `https://github.com/VoxLink-org/cueflow`
*   **Internal Links:**
    *   `#use-cases` (anchor link)
    *   `/live-stream-interaction`
    *   `/job-interview`
*   **Use Case Image URLs:** External URLs from Unsplash (e.g., `https://images.unsplash.com/...`).
*   **Icons:** Originally from `lucide-react`. These will need to be replaced with SVG files or an icon font in the Eleventy project.
